Welcome to the Crystal Collector Game!

Game Objective: Match your total score with the random number assigned at the beginning of the game by clicking the four crystals. 

Each crystal is assigned a random value at the beginning of the game. No two crystals are equal to each other. 

The game is designed to alert you when you have won or lost. The game will then reset the random number value and all of the crystal values. 

Have Fun playing!
